# how-nfl-injuries-change-a-teams-destiny
Executive Summary
Using NFL play by play data from the 2013 through 2019 regular seasons to see if there is a direct correlation between yards gained, scoring, and games won. As well as to compare the teams with the best overall offense and defense to see if either side of the ball helps a team to victory more than the other.

Motivation
I chose this project because football has been a big part of my life and is one of the things my wife and I like to watch together and I always wonder if a good defense or offense is more effective.

How many regular season games into the season do you need to reliably predict who will go to the super bowl.
Does the team with the better offense or defense win the super bowl.
What is the average number of injuries in the regular season for a team?
Does the amount of injuries affect a team's performance and which position has the biggest impact when an injury occurs.

Known Issues and Challenges
I am anticipating some issues with cleaning the data. There are a few instances of penalty plays getting called back and the data for the non play being logged. My plan for dealing with this is using EXCEL to find inconsistent final yardages and use VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP to find and fix these errors.
