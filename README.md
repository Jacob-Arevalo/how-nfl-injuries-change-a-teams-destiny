Executive Summary
Using NFL play by play data from the 2015 through 2018 regular seasons to see if NFL rule changes are helping decrease injury rates.

Motivation
I chose this project because football has been a big part of my life and is one of the things my wife and I like to watch together and I think for football to continue to thrive player saftey needs to be improved. I want to see if the NFL is doing a good job of this.

Known Issues and Challenges
I am anticipating some issues with cleaning the data. There are a few instances of penalty plays getting called back and the data for the non play being logged. My plan for dealing with this is using EXCEL to find inconsistent final yardages and use VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP to find and fix these errors.
